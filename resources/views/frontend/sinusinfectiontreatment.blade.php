                     <h2 class="theme-color">Types of Sinus Surgery</h2>
                     <h3 class="theme-color">Septoplasty</h3>
                       <p>Septoplasty is an outpatient sinus surgery that is done to correct the issues related to the midline of the nose. The treatment restructures the partitions which divide the nostrils known as the septum. Septoplasty redirects the alignment and opens the air passages by reconstructing the bone and cartilage.</p>
                        <h3 class="theme-color">Turbinate reduction</h3>
                        <p>The turbinate present in the nose can swell or get inflamed due to infection, irritation, or allergies resulting in nasal congestion. The Turbinate reduction sinus surgery reduces the size and swelling making it easier to breathe.</p>
                       <h3 class="theme-color">Functional rhinoplasty</h3>
                        <p>This sinus surgery procedure reconstructs the bone and cartilage that make the nose which removes the abnormalities that cause issues with breathing.</p>
                       <h3 class="theme-color">Balloon sinuplasty</h3>
                       <p>This is a less invasive procedure designed to help patients get relief from chronic sinusitis symptoms. A balloon sinusitis catheter is inserted into the sinus passage.</p>
                       <h3 class="theme-color">Functional endoscopic Sinus Surgery (FESS)</h3>
                       <p>FESS is carried out with the help of an instrument called an endoscope which is an illuminated, thin fiber-optic tube that is inserted in the nasal passage to reach the openings of the sinuses. This produces better drainage, reduces blockages, and flushes out all the infected material.</p>
                       
                      <h2 class="theme-color">Risks and Complications of Sinus Surgery</h2>
                      <p>The complications associated with Sinus surgery involve-</p>
                      <p><b>Bleeding-</b>bleeding tends to happen for at least 24 hours after the sinus surgery and can also happen for a few weeks to months.</p>
                      <p><b>Intracranial complications-</b>the septum attaches to the roof of the nose and a thin layer of bone may be damaged during a sinus infection.</p>
                      <p><b>Damage to the eye or surrounding tissue-</b>as sinuses are close to the eye they can lead to bleeding in the eye as well and this happens when the bone separating the sinus and eye is damaged and vision loss and blindness can be spotted.</p>
                      <p><b>Infection-</b>sinus infection is the main reason; a person undergoes sinus surgery. A person suffering from sinusitis can suffer from infection during surgery in that area.</p>
                      <p><b>Changes in a personâ€™s voice-</b>the sinus affects the resonance of a personâ€™s voice and complications during the sinus surgery can lead to a change in someoneâ€™s voice.</p>
                      <p><b>Loss of smell and taste-</b>after sinus surgery, the sense of smell usually improves as the air passages get cleared but due to swelling and infection can lead to a loss of smell and taste temporarily or can be prolonged.</p>
                      <p><b>Nasal issues-</b>sinus surgery usually clears the blockages in the airways but the surgery can worsen it as well. Small scars may develop due to the sinus infection treatment which requires another surgery to be treated.</p>
                      
                      <h2 class="theme-color">Recovery from the sinus infection treatment</h2>
                      <p>After the sinus infection treatment is completed, nasal packing may be used. Nasal packing is the insertion of sterile gauze material into the nasal passage to control bleeding.</p>
                      <p>Recovery periods differ based on the type of sinus surgery done and some other factors such as age and general health. A person may experience mild discomfort, fatigue, nasal congestion, and small amounts of bleeding. The doctor might prescribe pain medications during the recovery from the sinusitis (sinus infection) treatment in Delhi.</p>

                        <h3 class="theme-color">Septoplasty vs Sinus surgery</h3>
                        <p>Most of the patients get confused between septoplasty and sinus surgery and end up thinking the same. However, both treatment procedures result in the expansion of the nasal cavity. Septoplasty is the procedure to treat the blocked airways caused by a deviated nasal septum while sinus surgery is done to treat chronic sinus infection.</p>
                         <p>Septoplasty requires a cut on one side of the nose which makes it an invasive procedure while our sinus surgery in Delhi is comparatively less invasive with a fast recovery.
