                        <p>Even though scientists developed the idea of a device that helps sound vibrations bypass the injured areas of the ear, it was around 1980 when such a device started to become available for everyone.</p>
                        <p>From children to old people, everyone is eligible to have cochlear implant surgery. If you are thinking about getting such an implant for yourself, here are some surprising facts that you should know about the cochlear implants.</p>
                        <h5>1. It is not an Implanted Hearing Aid</h5>
                        <p>There is a huge difference between the hearing aids and the cochlear implants. While hearing aids only amplify sound, cochlear implants change sound vibrations into signals so that it can bypass the injured areas of your ear. If a hearing aid is not helping you enough, you must find out if you may be a Cochlear Implant candidate.</p>
                        
                        <h5>2. It Is not connected Through Your skull</h5>
                        <p>As most people can only see the external processor of the implant, they have this wrong notion. The truth is, you will require surgery to insert the receiver part of the implant and the electrodes.</p>
                        
                        <h5>3. You Can Go Swimming</h5>
                        <p>Do you understand the difference between water resistance and water-proof? Then you will know whether the cochlear implant you are choosing is good for swimming or not. You can wear a water-resistant device while swimming or taking part in different water sports. However, if your machine is water-resistant, you just have to remove the external device before going into the water.</p>
                        
                        <h5>4. You Can Play Sports</h5>
                        <p>For the sports that require you to wear a helmet, you have to wear protective headgear to protect the external device. Otherwise, you do not even have to wear any headgear for protecting the device. From gymming to playing sports like football and basketball, you can do everything while wearing the implant.</p>
                        
                        <h5>5. Age Does Not Matter</h5>
                        <p>Although we mostly see children getting cochlear implants, babies, as well as people in their 90s, can have such implants as well. The only cause of getting such an implant is that you have to be healthy to undergo the surgery. The infants who get the implant earlier in their life benefit from picking up the language earlier than the children who get the implant later.</p>
                        
                        <h5>6. No Replacements</h5>
                        <p>Unless the internal electrodes malfunctions or breaks, or the wire gets damaged, there is no need for you to replace the cochlear implants. These implants are designed to last for years. Also, children do not outgrow the implants. That means they do not require any replacements of their implants as they grow.</p>
                         
                        <h5>7. Cochlear Implants Can Be Costly</h5>
                        <p>The costs of the cochlear implant vary depending on the facility & type of Implant selected.</p>
                        <p>These are only a handful of information about cochlear implants. You can know more about them by conducting a little research. The more you gather knowledge, the easier it will be for you to make a knowledgeable decision.</p>
