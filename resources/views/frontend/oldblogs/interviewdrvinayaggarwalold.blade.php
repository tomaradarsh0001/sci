                        <h5>Q. What is Ortho-biologics?  </h5>
                        <p>A. Simply said, Orthobiologics is utilizing natural substances in one’s own body, processing them to extract valuable growth-promoting substrates in our modern labs & using them to promote healing in various orthopaedic problems related to bones, joints, tendons, ligaments & muscles.</p>
                        
                        
                        <h5>Q. What are the side -effects of this treatment?</h5>
                        <p>A. A common criticism of allopathic medicine is the side effects of chemicals or side -effects of surgery. With Ortho-biologics, simply said we amalgamate the modern science of orthopaedics with NATURE using our state of art laboratory set up in harvesting the natural substrates in the body, processing & enriching them & finally using the same substances harvested from one’s own body for healing various diseases linked to bones & joints.</p>
                        <p> In one way we can say its</p>
                        <p># herbal Orthopaedics </p>
                        <p># Bridge Therapy (the bridge between nature & modern science)</p>

                        <h5>Q. What are the common conditions which can be treated by Orthobiologic treatment?</h5>

                        <p>A. At SCI, we have the fortune of having a high-quality infrastructure & Laboratory set up by virtue of us being the established market leader in IVF &  embryo transfer technology.</p>
                        <p>We have all modern state of the art equipment for harvesting bone marrow, stem cell extraction, stem cell banking, Platelet-rich plasma technology & ultra-modern Image-guided injection systems for precise placement of the substrate. All these equipment demands a considerable expenditure, However, being a part of the SCI family,  our orthopaedic department is fortunate to have access to such laboratory setup for utilization in Orthobiologics & that’s why we can offer such expensive treatments available internationally at really low cost in the heart of Delhi.</p>
