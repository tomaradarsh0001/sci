                        <p>Do you have any idea about a breech baby? Most of you would say – No. The term ‘Breech Baby’ might be new for many pregnant ladies. Don’t get surprised, if you hear this term, right before heading for normal delivery.</p>
                        <h5>Breech Baby: What Does It Mean?   </h5>
                        <p>Just before birth, most babies remain in a headfirst position inside the uterus of the mother. But, in some cases, when the baby is in bottom-first position i.e., feet-first position, it’s referred to as breech birth. The baby is called a breech baby. In simple words, when the position of the baby’s feet and the bottom is downwards towards the cervix, it is known as a breech baby condition. </p>
                        <p>Usually, the head of a baby is faced downwards right during birth. Sometimes, the baby’s position might be head-up inside the uterus. This condition is referred to as a breech pregnancy.</p>
                        
                        
                        <h5>Does Breech Pregnancy Pose Some Challenge? </h5>
                        <p>Say the challenges mainly difficulty in vaginal delivery as the after coming head can get stuck and maybe life-threatening for the baby.</p>
                        <h5>Breech Baby: What Are The Causes?</h5>
                        <p>There is no explicit cause for breech baby birth. However, certain conditions that might trigger a baby to breech are mentioned below:</p>
                        <ul class="list_blog">
                            <li>Abnormal level of amniotic fluid, either it’s very low or it’s too much.</li>
                            <li>Low lying placenta which is covering the cervix partially.</li>
                            <li>If the woman is heading towards premature delivery.</li>
                            <li>Pregnant with more than one baby.</li>
                            <li>The shape of the uterus might be a bit abnormal.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                       
                        <p>There is nothing to freak if you hear that you are heading towards breech pregnancy. It’s a very common thing for the babies to turn inside the uterus. Studies showed that even one week before the due date, babies have turned from their usual position.</p>
                        <h5>Why Is Breech Birth Difficult?  </h5>
                        <p>Breech birth through the vaginal section is a bit difficult and can lead to some complications. After all, the big part of the baby, i.e. the head is going to come out last. Hence, a C-section might be advised by doctors. However, before heading for a Caesarean delivery, it’s better to consult with a doctor. A doctor can tell if the breech position, such as Flexed Breech or Footling Breech, etc would be suitable for a vaginal birth or not.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Turning a Breech Baby</h5>
                        <p>There is nothing wrong with turning a breech baby. For turning the position of a breech baby, certain exercises and medical procedures need to be followed. To correct the position of a breech baby, External Cephalic Version ECV procedure is followed. On the other hand, physiotherapy could also help in this situation.</p>
                        <p>Myths are associated with breech babies. However, these myths don’t have any scientific base. What one needs to understand is that it’s a medical condition that is pretty normal during pregnancies.</p>
