                        <p>Oral care is as important as taking care of any other body part and should be an important part of our daily routine. But it is majorly neglected by most. Oral care refers to taking care of your mouth, tongue and teeth. It does not just end with brushing your teeth as a morning ritual, there’s more to it. People don’t take dental health care seriously which later results in severe problems. Oral cancer also results from non-maintenance of dental hygiene and is life-threatening, if not treated at the earliest.</p>
