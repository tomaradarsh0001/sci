                        <p>Male infertility occurs due to problems affecting either sperm transport or sperm production in men. Around two-thirds of men with infertility have a problem making sperm in the testes. It usually affects around 7% of males due to certain deficiencies in their semen quality – either lower sperm count or sperm don’t work properly.  </p>
                        <p>Reproduction is a natural process in most couples. However, some couples find it difficult to conceive. The fertility of a man typically depends on his sperm quality and quantity. If the sperm count is poor quality or low in number, it’s difficult or impossible to cause pregnancy.  </p>
                        <p>Reportedly, approximately 12–18 million couples in India face the issue of infertility every year. Some reports also suggest that the sperm count of an average Indian male used to be around 60 million/ml 30 years ago. However, it’s around 20 million/ml now.  </p>

                        <p>Low sperm count means when semen or fluid ejaculated by a man during an orgasm includes fewer sperm than average sperm count.  </p>
                        <p><strong>The condition of low sperm count is also known as oligospermia  </strong></p>

                            <li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> With a low sperm count, there are fewer chances of causing pregnancy in a fertile female.  </li>

                        <p>Male infertility is diagnosed through a medical test that proves that the problem is found in the male. In most cases, you cannot find any obvious signs of infertility. Intercourse, ejaculations, and erections usually occur without difficulty. Only a medical test can diagnose male infertility and its exact cause in the male.  </p>

                            <li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> Abnormal sperm production due to genetic defects, undescended testicles, health problems like diabetes, or infections, such as gonorrhea, Chlamydia, HIV, or mumps. Enlarged veins within the testes can also affect sperm quality.  </li>
                            <li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> Issues with sperm delivery because of sexual problems like genetic conditions, such as cystic fibrosis, premature ejaculation, injury or damage to reproductive organs, and structural problems like a blockage in one or both testicles.</li>
                            <li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> Overexposure to specific environmental factors like chemicals, pesticides, and radiation. Alcohol, cigarette smoking, anabolic steroids, marijuana, and taking medications for treating high blood pressure, depression, and bacterial infections may also affect fertility in men. Frequent heat exposure during hot tub baths or saunas can also affect sperm production.  </li>
                            <li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> Damage caused by cancer and its treatment, such as chemotherapy and exposure to radiation, can also impair sperm production.  </li>

                        <p>The main sign of infertility is when you’re not able to get pregnant. There can be some other obvious signs and symptoms as well. In some cases, an infertile man may have certain signs of sexual problems or hormonal issues like erectile dysfunction or reduced body hair growth.  </p>
