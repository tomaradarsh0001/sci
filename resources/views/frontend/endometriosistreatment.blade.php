                        <p>Endometriosis is irrecoverable, but a manageable gynecological medical condition. It happens when endometrial implants, comprising of tissue found in the uterus, build up in different body parts. It further prepares the womb lining for ovulation, growing in areas outside the uterus.</p>
                        <p>When they grow outside the uterus, this condition is known as endometriosis. They can also develop in any body part but usually occur in the pelvic region. Endometriosis affects around 6% to 10% of women worldwide.</p>
                        <p>They may affect:</p>

                        <p>These tissues usually expel during menstruation; however, the displaced tissue can’t do it. The growing lesions can grow larger and lead to physical symptoms, such as pain, and affects bodily functions like the ability to work, etc.</p>

                        <p>The major symptom of endometriosis is severe pelvic pain that’s usually related to menstrual periods. This pain also increases over time.</p>
                        <p><strong>General signs and symptoms of endometriosis are:</strong></p>
                        <ul class="services_list">
                            <li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> Painful periods (also called dysmenorrhoea): The cramping and pelvic pain may start early and remain even after the menstrual cycle. You may even feel abdominal and lower back pain.</li>
                            <li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> Pain with intercourse: One feels pain during or after intercourse.</li>
                            <li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> Pain with urination or bowel movements: One experiences these symptoms at the time of the menstrual cycle.</li>
                            <li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> Excessive bleeding: One may experience inter-menstrual bleeding or heavy menstrual periods.</li>
                            <li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> Infertility: Sometimes, this condition can also be observed in women seeking infertility treatment.</li>
                            <li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> Other symptoms include fatigue, constipation, diarrhea, nausea, or bloating especially during menstrual periods.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The severity of pain is not a reliable indicator of this condition. You may experience mild endometriosis with severe pain or you could experience advanced endometriosis with minimal or no pain.</p>

                        <h2 class="theme-color">Causes of Endometriosis </h2>
                        <p>What exactly causes endometriosis is not known. However, there are various theories associated with the causes of this medical condition.</p>
                        <p>The oldest theory states that it occurs because of retrograde menstruation. It happens when the menstrual blood begins to flow back through fallopian tubes into the pelvic cavity rather than leaving the body through the vagina.</p>
                        <p>Another theory states that hormones turn the cells outside the uterus into cells equivalent to the lining within the uterus called endometrial cells.</p>
                        <p>Some also believe that this condition occurs in some areas of the abdomen and is converted into endometrial tissue. It happens when the abdominal cells start growing from embryonic cells that change their shape and start acting like endometrial cells.</p>
                        <p>Some also believe that endometriosis begins in the fetal period when misplaced cell tissues respond to puberty hormones. This is also known as the Mullerian theory. Endometriosis development is also linked to genetics or environmental toxins.</p>

                        <h3 class="theme-color">Treatment Options of Endometriosis </h3>
                        <p><strong>For treating endometriosis, surgery is possible. However, it is considered only when other treatment options don’t work or are not effective. Other treatment options are:</strong></p>
                        
                        <p><b>Pain medications:</b> The specialists may prescribe either nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen (Motrin IB, Advil, others) and over-the-counter (OTC) drugs or other prescription drugs for treating painful menses.</p>
                        <p><b>Hormones:</b> Endometriosis can also be treated with hormonal therapies, which include Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (Gn-RH) agonists and antagonists, hormonal birth control, Danazol, and Medroxyprogesterone (Depo-Provera). Besides, the placement of the intrauterine device (IUD) could be suggested by the specialist for the treatment.</p>
                        <p><b>Surgery: </b>The initial surgery may seek the removal of the areas of endometriosis. However, a hysterectomy may be necessary with the removal of both ovaries.</p>
                        <p><b>Fertility treatment:</b> In this case, the pregnancy is recommended through in-vitro fertilization (IVF).</p>
