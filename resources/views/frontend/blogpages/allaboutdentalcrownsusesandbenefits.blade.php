Earlier, it was very difficult to help with tooth problems but with the advancement of technology, damaged teeth can now be treated with various methodologies. There has not been enough awareness about these procedures. </p>

                        <h2>What Is a Dental Crown? </h2>
                        <p>As the name suggests, dental crowns are used on top of damaged teeth. These are tooth-shaped caps that can help in covering your damaged teeth and give them the time to restore to get normal. Dental Crowns cover the weak tooth to prevent it from breaking and further damage.  </p>
                        <p>These are placed in such a way that they hold the tooth like a blanket. This works as a support to the damaged tooth. The dental crown, when aligned properly over the tooth, will cover the entire visible portion of the tooth. This helps the damaged or decayed teeth to restore their shape, size, and color. Weighing all the advantages provided by dental crowns, they pose as a highly recommended and used method by dentists.  </p>
                         
                        <h2>Types of Dental Crowns</h2>
                        <p>There are different types of dental crowns depending on the cost and usage. Some of the commonly used dental crowns are as follows:  </p>
                        
                        <h3>Metal Alloy based Crowns</h3>

                        <h3>Ceramic Crowns</h3>

                        <h3>Taking Care of Dental Crowns </h3>
                        <p>While dental crowns can be a great addition to helping you with dental problems, they should be taken proper care of. These tips are very important for getting temporary crowns. They are as follows:  </p>
                        <p>Stay away from sticky or extra chewy food. In this case, the food might get stuck to the crown and involve the risk of dislocating them by pulling it at a certain time.  </p>
                        <p>Try to shift bulk chewing of food particles to the good side of the teeth. It’s better to minimize the workload of the temporary crowns. Refrain from including hard vegetables in the diet. They put a lot of pressure on the crowns. Also, try to avoid undercooked food items. When using dental floss, slide it from between the teeth rather than lifting it. This is to avoid unnecessary pulling off the crowns.  </p>
                        <p>These precautionary measures are significant in taking care of temporary dental crowns and avoiding any unnecessary accidents before the permanent ones are made. </p>
