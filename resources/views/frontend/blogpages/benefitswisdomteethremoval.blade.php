                        <p>The last set of molars in the back of the mouth are called wisdom teeth.Most of the time, they show up between the ages of 17 and 25, which is often called the "age of wisdom" or maturity. With the help of these teeth, we can chew hard foods, but it also causes big trouble for a person when it starts growing in the wrong positions, and it causes discomfort to the individual. The unbearable pain of wisdom teeth is not easy to handle for everyone, and that's why it is important to have a wisdom tooth extracted otherwise, the person couldn't even eat food properly and feel pain in their jaw all the time. Here, you get a proper understanding of wisdom tooth removal, from what problems wisdom teeth can cause to the benefits of wisdom teeth removal.</p>
                    
                       <h2>What will happen if we don't have our wisdom tooth extracted?</h2>
                       
                       <p>Here are some of the most common problems that occur when you donâ€™t get rid of wisdom teeth:</p>
                       
                       <ul>
                           <li><b>Pain and Discomfort:</b> One of the most immediate consequences is persistent pain and discomfort, especially if the wisdom tooth is impacted or erupts at an odd angle.</li>
                           <li><b>Risk of Infections:</b> Leaving impacted wisdom teeth in place can increase the risk of infections, leading to conditions like pericoronitis, where the gum tissue around the tooth becomes inflamed and infected.</li>
                           <li><b>Tooth Crowding:</b> Wisdom teeth can push neighboring teeth, causing misalignment and crowding, which may necessitate orthodontic treatment.</li>
                           <li><b>Cysts and Tumors:</b> In some cases, cysts or tumors can develop around impacted wisdom teeth, which may require more extensive surgical procedures to remove.</li>
                           <li><b>Chronic Headaches:</b> The discomfort and pressure from problematic wisdom teeth can contribute to chronic headaches.</li>
                           <li><b>Impaired Oral Function:</b> As pain and discomfort worsen, chewing and speaking can become more challenging.</li>
                           <li><b>Emergency Extraction:</b> Delaying extraction may result in the need for emergency removal due to sudden, severe pain or complications.</li>
                           <li><b>Damage to Nearby Teeth: </b>Wisdom teeth that don't erupt properly can damage adjacent teeth by causing decay, erosion, or pushing against them.</li>
                           <li><b>Difficulty in Cleaning:</b> Wisdom teeth are located at the back of the mouth, making them difficult to clean properly, increasing the risk of cavities and gum disease.</li>
                       </ul>

                      <h3>What is the Good Time to Get A Wisdom Tooth Extracted</h3>
                      
                      <p>The right time for wisdom teeth removal depends on various situations, and these situations are:</p>
                      <ul>
                          <li>Dentists use X-rays and clinical exams to evaluate wisdom teeth development for extraction necessity.</li>
                          <li>Pain, swelling, or discomfort around wisdom teeth may signal a need for prompt extraction.</li>
                          <li>Impacted or misaligned wisdom teeth often require early extraction to prevent dental issues.</li>
                          <li>Dentists weigh potential complications like infections, cysts, or damage to nearby teeth.</li>
                          <li>Extraction timing may be influenced by ongoing or future orthodontic plans.</li>
                          <li>Extraction decisions consider overall oral health and prevention of future problems.</li>
                          <li>Timing varies based on individual health and pain tolerance.</li>
                      </ul>

                      <h3>What happens during the process of extraction?</h3>
                      
                      <p>The process of wisdom teeth extraction follows these methods:</p>
                      <p><b>Anesthesia:</b> Local anesthesia numbs the area around the wisdom tooth to minimize pain during the procedure.</p>
                      <p><b>Incision:</b> Sometimes, an incision in the gum tissue is necessary to access the tooth.</p>
                      <p><b>Tooth Removal:</b> The dentist uses specialized instruments to carefully extract the wisdom tooth from its socket.</p>
                      <p><b>Stitching:</b> If needed, stitches are used to close the incision and aid in healing.</p>
                      <p><b>Gauze Placement:</b> Gauze is positioned at the extraction site to control bleeding and promote clot formation.</p>
                      
                      
                      <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                      <p>Wisdom tooth removal is an important aspect because wisdom tooth not only brings maturity but also a lot of pain and problems. If it causes you any trouble, it should be removed as soon as possible to improve general oral health, avoid complications, infections, and long-term effects, and ensure a brighter, pain-free dental future.</p>
