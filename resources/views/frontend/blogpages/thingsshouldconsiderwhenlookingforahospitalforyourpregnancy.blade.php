                        <h2 class="theme-color">Hospital Reputation:</h2>
                        <p>The hospital's reputation matters when choosing where to have your baby. Look for hospitals that have a good track record when it comes to prenatal care, delivery, and postpartum care. You can research a hospital's reputation online or ask for recommendations from friends or family members who have given birth at a hospital.  </p>
                        
                        <h2 class="theme-color">Location:</h2>
                        <p>The hospital's location is also crucial. It's best to choose a hospital that is easily accessible, especially during labor and delivery.

                        <p>Tour the hospital's labor and delivery unit or such as private rooms, birthing centers, and neonatal intensive care units.
