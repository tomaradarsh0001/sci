                        <p>Ovarian cysts form inside your ovaries. They are typically sacs filled with fluid and not cancerous in nature. Ovarian cysts can be diagnosed via ultrasound or different other imaging tests that will aid your physician in looking at their sizes. While nearly all ovarian cysts fail to exhibit any symptoms, still you may suddenly experience pain and discomfort in the event of a rupture of the cysts.</p>
                        <h2>Ovarian cysts and pregnancy</h2>
                        <p>The formation of ovarian cysts is expected during the early stages of your pregnancy, although you are not menstruating anymore. By and large ovarian cysts are benign in nature. </p>
                        <p>But, some potential issues may crop up if the cysts keep on growing for the duration of your pregnancy. For example, the cysts might get ruptured or twisted, besides causing problems in the course of childbirth. That is why you must constantly be under the care and monitoring of an obstetrician or a gynaecologist for the period of your pregnancy. </p>
                        <p>Suppose you are struck down with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). In that case, it exposes you to increased risks of contracting pregnancy-triggered high blood pressure, gestational diabetes, premature delivery, or even a miscarriage.</p>
                        <h2>Do ovarian cysts cause infertility?</h2>
                        <p>It is essential to know that ovarian cysts do not usually lead to fertility problems. But, a few ovarian cysts have links with a drop in your fertility level. But, it is totally dependent on the ovarian cyst type you have developed.</p>
                        <p>If you still have confusion over <a href="https://scihospital.com/ovarian-cryst-treatment">Ovarian Cyst Treatment</a> you should take expert advice.</p>
                        
                        <h2>Fertility affecting ovarian cysts include the following:</h2>
                        <h3><a href="https://scihospital.com/endometriosis-treatment">Endometriomas</a></h3>
                        <p>The cause of these ovarian cysts is endometriosis. It is a condition wherein the tissue that forms the normal uterine lining (endometrium) starts growing outside your uterus. Endometriomas are believed to result in infertility.  </p>
                        <h3>Ovarian cysts caused by polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)</h3>
                        <p>PCOS is a condition in which there is a growth of small cysts in your ovaries. As a consequence, your menstrual periods become irregular. The condition raises the levels of a few reproductive hormones. PCOS also gives rise to an atypical ovulation process, which is thought to be responsible for causing infertility in women.</p>
                        <h3>Ovarian cysts that do not cause fertility problems include the following.</h3>
                        <p>These cysts are most commonly formed inside the ovaries. Types of functional cysts are follicular cysts and corpus luteum cysts. The formation of functional cysts usually takes place in the course of a regular menstrual cycle. They are not found to be causing or contributing to infertility issues. Instead, functional cysts signify that the functions necessary to bring about fertility or increase its level are occurring. </p>
                        <h3>Cystadenomas</h3>
                        <p>These are growths that develop on the ovarian surface. Even though the development of cystadenomas calls for treatment, there are no pieces of evidence gathered so far that indicate they cause infertility.</p>

                        <h3>Dermoid cysts </h3>
                        
                        <p>Dermoid cysts have everything to do with epidermal tissues such as skin, hair, teeth, etc. The cysts are not filled with fluid. No link between dermoid cysts and infertility has been established yet.</p>
                        <p>If you are diagnosed with ovarian cysts and planning to get pregnant, it is crucial that you get in touch with your OB/GYN, who will suggest potential treatment options to increase your odds to conceive.</p>
