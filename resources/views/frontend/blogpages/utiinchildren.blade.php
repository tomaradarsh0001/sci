                       <p>Bladder infections in children, also known as urinary tract infections, often occur when bacteria enter the urinary tract, usually through the skin around the rectum and genitals. Detecting urinary tract infections in children can be hard, especially if they're too young to express their discomfort. Prompt treatment is crucial to prevent the infection from spreading and causing potential harm to their kidneys. Even adults can experience urinary tract infections, highlighting the importance of awareness and timely care.</p>
