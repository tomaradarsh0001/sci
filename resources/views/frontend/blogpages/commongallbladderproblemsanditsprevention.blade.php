                        <p>An unhealthy lifestyle can lead to external as well as internal risks in our bodies. Many times, we ignore our internal health. We focus on the diseases that are visible to our naked eye. Due to this, we tend to ignore symptoms of high-risk health conditions.  </p>
                        <p>When it comes to the gallbladder, we often miss out on signs that can indicate severe complications. Later, these slowly damage our bladder and complicate our health. At times, the gallbladder is removed. The problem is that there is a lack of awareness concerning the problems associated with the gallbladder.  </p>
                        <p>Let’s understand what it means.  </p>
                        
                        <h2>What is Gallbladder disorder?  </h2>
                        <p>The gall bladder is an organ that stores bile and passes it on to the intestine during the digestion process. It is positioned right under our liver. Do you feel sudden pain at times from the stomach area? We don’t give much thought to that. But this could mean that there is some problem with the bile duct which can hinder our digestion.  </p>
                        <p>Before understanding the common gallbladder problem, let’s look at some common symptoms.  </p>
                        
                        <h3>Symptoms of a Gallbladder problem</h3>
                        
                        <p>Watch out for these signs and symptoms:  </p>

                            <li>Jaundice</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                       
                        <p>These are some common signs which indicate that our gallbladder is not healthy and might be symptoms of major health conditions.  </p>
                        <p>Have you heard of gallbladder stones? This might sound familiar to many but it is not the only complication arising due to gallbladder problems. Also, when gallbladder stones remain untreated for long periods, they can cause other health risks.  </p>
                        <p>Let’s discuss some of the common gallbladder problems:  </p>
                        
                        <h3>Common Gallbladder Problems  </h3>
                        
                        <h3>Gallstones  </h3>
                        <p>They are also known as gallbladder stones; it is one of the most commonly heard problems that arise from an unhealthy gallbladder. A sudden painful cramp in your upper abdomen may be a symptom of this. It’s important to treat these immediately before it turns perilous.  </p>
                        <p>Sometimes, these stones may get stuck in your bile duct and block the secretion of bile. That’s when you need immediate medical care.  </p>
                        
                        <h3>Cholecystitis  </h3>
                        <p>Inflammation in the gallbladder is known as cholecystitis. This can be the result of Gallstones, bacteria, fungi, or tumors. The gallbladder gets swollen and you can feel a shooting pain in your belly. Immediate treatment needs to be followed and will include the removal of the gallbladder.  </p>
                        
                        <h3>Perforated Gallbladder  </h3>
                        <p>Formation of tiny holes in the gallbladder results in a perforated bladder. When the gallstones are not treated on time, they create holes in the walls of your gallbladder. This can turn into a life-threatening situation. Consult your doctor immediately if you feel nauseous or have a high fever.  </p>
                        
                        <h3>Gallbladder Cancer</h3>
                        <p>It is very rare and difficult to detect. Gallbladder cancer shows no symptoms at the early stages. Severe abdominal pain, sudden weight loss, jaundice, or bloating are some symptoms of gallbladder cancer. An unhealthy lifestyle is the main reason for this. Gallstone also must be associated with cancer in later life  </p>
                        
                        <h3>Empyema</h3>
                        <p>It is also known as a gallbladder abscess. This arises due to an infection from the buildup of bile. It requires professional care. The infection will spread faster & needs earlier removal of the gallbladder.  </p>
                        <p>These are some common gallbladder problems. But have you heard about the complications associated with these problems in the long run?  </p>

                        <h3>Prevention of common gallbladder Problems  </h3>
                        
                        
                        <h5>Healthy diet  </h5>
                        <p>Clean eating on a healthy routine can do wonders for your body. We tend to underestimate this point a lot. Majorly, gallbladder problems arise due to unhealthy eating habits. Include fibers in your diet. It’s a slow process but can give tremendous results.  </p>
                        
                        <h5>Exercise  </h5>
                        <p>Regular exercising keeps your body fit. An active lifestyle is as important as a healthy diet. Eating good food alone cannot keep your body healthy internally. If you can’t work out. Try to include walking and other physical daily workouts in your routine. Such as taking the stairs instead of the elevator.  </p>
                        
                        <h5>Avoid junk food and fizzy drinks</h5>
                        <p>Food with high sugar and fat content is poisonous to our health. Try to cut back as much as you can. It can be difficult at first. Take the progress slow and achieve a healthier body and mind. Carbonated and fizzy drinks also add up to the disasters happening internally.  </p>
                        
                        <h5>Body Weight</h5>
                        <p>Rather than aiming for a slim figure, keep yourself fit. Losing lots of weight at a stretch can affect your metabolism. Always focus on staying healthy not just externally but also internally.  </p>
                        
                        <h5>Regular Body checkups</h5>
                        <p>It is very important to schedule full body checkups at regular intervals. Many times, we miss out on symptoms and increase the risk. Body checkups help you in detecting diseases at their early stage.  </p>
                        <p>Follow these precautionary measures to prevent gallbladder diseases. Take a step towards a healthy and beautiful life.  </p>
