                    <h2>Detecting Kidney Stones?</h2>
                        <p>People are becoming health conscious. They want to know if they are having stones in their kidneys or not. It's possible to know if they are having kidney stones or not by taking a look into some early signs.</p>
                        
                        <h2>Early Warning Signs and Symptoms of Kidney Stones</h2>
                        <p><b>Pain: </b>Kidney stone pain, also called renal colic, is really strong. It feels like childbirth pain and comes on suddenly, lasting a long time. You'll feel the pain on your sides and below your ribs. When you pee, the pain can get really strong, causing a burning feeling. These signs are clear indicators that you might have kidney stones.</p>
                        <p><b>Nausea: </b>People with a kidney stone will get a feeling of nausea. It gets triggered as the kidneys and the gastrointestinal tract share the same nerve connection.</p>
                        <p><b>Blood in Urine: </b>The presence of brown or red blood in urine signals the existence of kidney stones within the urinary tract.</p>
                        <p><b>UTI Symptoms:</b>A kidney stone may cause urinary tract infection symptoms, including discomfort and smelly or cloudy urine. See a doctor if you have these symptoms to rule out kidney stones.</p>
                        <p><b>Urine Flow Blockage: </b>If a person is unable to urinate, it could be a symptom of kidney stones. Often, the stones slow down the urine flow. Seeing a doctor at this time is important.</p>
                        <p><b>Fever: </b>A fever, along with other symptoms of kidney stones, is a sure indicator that a person suffers from kidney stones.</p>
                        <p><b>Pee Often: </b>The need to urinate often is another sign of stones being present in the urinary tract.</p>
                        <p>With proper lifestyle and dietary changes, the chance of suffering from kidney stones can be greatly lowered. If you feel you are experiencing kidney stones symptoms, then consulting with a healthcare professional might resolve all your worries.</p>
