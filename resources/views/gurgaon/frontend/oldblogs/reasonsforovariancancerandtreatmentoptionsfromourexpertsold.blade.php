                        <p>Ovarian cancer is a form of cancer that affects one or both of the ovaries of women. When the DNA in a cell of your ovary stops working properly, it creates abnormal cell growth. This is what Ovarian cancer is. The cancer cells form tumors in your ovary.</p>
                        <p>If you leave Ovarian cancer untreated, the cancerous cells can spread to other parts of your body as well. The doctors and researchers are still unable to find out the cause of this type of cancer. However, the following factors might enhance your chance of getting ovarian cancer.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Increasing Age</h5>
                        <p>As you get older, the risk of getting ovarian cancer increases. The researchers have pointed out that most cases of ovarian cancer happen after menopause. However, some unusual types of ovarian cancer happen to younger women.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Family and Genes</h5>
                        <p>If someone in your family had ovarian cancer, then your chances of getting cancer enhances. The risk increases particularly if one of your close relatives has had it.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Hormone Replacement Therapy</h5>
                        <p>It has been suggested that the risk of getting ovarian cancer increases if you take hormone replacement therapy. However, the studies have shown conflicting results.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Endometriosis</h5>
                        <p>The researches indicated that women suffering from endometriosis have an enhanced risk of suffering from ovarian cancer.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Weight</h5>
                        <p>People with a BMI of over 30 are more vulnerable to ovarian cancer. Regular exercising and reducing the weight might lessen the risk as well.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Reproductive History</h5>
                        <p>Having one or more full-term pregnancy is associated with a lower risk of ovarian cancer. The more pregnancies a woman has, the lower the risks are. Breastfeeding the child can be yet another reason for ovarian cancer.</p>
                         
                        <h5>Gynecologic Surgery</h5>
                        <p>Having surgery to remove the uterus can reduce the risk of having ovarian cancer by one third.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Smoking</h5>
                        <p>Smoking can be yet another factor that enhances the risk of ovarian cancer. Quitting smoking can reduce the risk of getting cancer significantly.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Using Talcum Powder</h5>
                        <p>Some research suggests that using talcum powder between your legs can enhance the chances of having ovarian cancer. However, the evidence for this is inconsistent.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Exposure to asbestos</h5>
                        <p>Asbestos is a whitish material that was used in the construction of building, roofing, insulation, and flooring. Exposure to this element can significantly enhance the risk of getting ovarian cancer.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="mt-2">Treatment Options</h3>
                        <h5>Surgery</h5>
                        <p>It is the main treatment for ovarian cancer. The aim is to remove all of cancer as much as it is possible.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Chemotherapy</h5>
                        <p>Chemotherapy is the treatment where medicine is used to kill the cancer cells. Most women suffering from ovarian cancer receive chemotherapy along with surgery.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Radiotherapy</h5>
                        <p>In radiotherapy, the doctors use direct beams of radiation to kill the cancer cells. Even though this therapy is generally not used for ovarian cancer, however, it may be used after surgery to kill any remaining cancer cells.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Targeted Therapies</h5>
                        <p>It is conducted using medicines that change the way cells work and stop cancer from spreading and growing.</p>
                        
                        <p>So, these are some common factors and treatment options for ovarian cancer. It is always better to have regular check-ups to make sure your ovaries are healthy. Talk to the doctors in case of any emergencies.</p>
