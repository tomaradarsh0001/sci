                        <p>In our society, infertility is a serious issue. When speaking about infertility, most people consider it a woman’s issue. However, this is not true always. According to the American Society of Reproductive Medicine, a man can be also the primary cause of infertility among couples.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Dealing with Male Infertility </h5>
                        <p>The cause of male infertility could be many. Some of the common causes include sperm production disorder, obstructive azoospermia, non-obstructive azoospermia, immunologic disorders, and more.</p>
                        <p>Most men find it hard to accept that they are the primary cause of infertility. Women can cope with it easily with time but it’s not the same for men. Men think that they can fix the problem but when they can’t they start to get frustrated. Some men might try to distance themselves; however, at this point, families and especially their respective spouses should be extremely supportive.</p>
                        <p>Don’t worry. A lot of things can be done to help men struggling with male infertility. Let’s check out.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Stop Smoking </h5>
                        <p>In men, smoking can be a cause for fertility issues. It can lower the quality of the sperm and reduce sperm count. Also, it affects the sperm’s ability to swim. So stop smoking and see improvements.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Cut Down Alcohol</h5>
                        <p>In men, alcohol affects male fertility by reducing the testosterone level and increasing the estrogen level. Estrogen reduces the production of sperm. Well, cutting down alcohol intake might help to deal with infertility issues.</p>
                        
                        
                        <h5>Say No to Drugs</h5>
                        <p>Men who are into recreational drugs, such as anabolic steroids must stop using them if planning to conceive. Often, drugs like marijuana can affect sperm production, the leading cause of male infertility.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Sperm Check </h5>
                        <p>Men who are struggling with male infertility issues should get their sperm count check. There are many ways to get sperm count tested. One can test it at home with some test kits or one can also consult an expert doctor.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Shed Pounds</h5>
                        <p>Are you obese? If yes, it would affect your sperm quality and sperm count. Studies showed overweight men face low sperm counts compared to a normal-weight person. Lose weight to keep the reproductive hormone in check.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Keep Medical Conditions under Check </h5>
                        <p>Chronic medical conditions, like cystic fibrosis, affect male infertility. Often, medicines for depression or high blood pressure influence fertility. Hence, men who are struggling with infertility issues should talk with their doctor about the medication that they are taking.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Eating Vitamins</h5>
                        <p>Multivitamins can help to increase sperm count in men. The antioxidants improve sperm quality and protect from free radicals that might damage the DNA of the sperm cells.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Exercising </h5>
                        <p>Physical exercise helps to deal with fertility issues in men.</p>
                        
                        
                        <h5>Healthy Food </h5>
                        <p>Consuming healthy food, rich in antioxidants helps in the production of healthy sperms. Fruits, whole grains, vegetables, etc have a link with good fertility and should be taken.</p>
                        <p>The issue of infertility isn’t much discussed. Even if it’s discussed, it is behind the close doors. After all, the infertility issue is associated with a stigma. So the best way to deal with male infertility is to get diagnosed and treated on time.</p>
