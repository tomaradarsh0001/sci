                        <p>Feeling the first movement of your baby is definitely one of the most delightful and amazing experiences for every mother. It is also one of the most important signs that tell you about the health and well being of your baby. Understanding the movements of your baby and what it means can help you get an insight into how your baby is doing in there. Want to know about the meanings of the movements? Check the following section of this article.</p>
                        
                        <h5>The First Movement </h5>
                        <p>Generally, the baby starts to move around the tummy of their mothers pretty early on. However, because of the small size of the fetus, the mothers generally do not feel that movement. However, most pregnant mothers feel the movement of their babies during the 18 and 22 weeks of their pregnancy.</p>
                        <p>However, you should keep in mind that this is an average time frame. Some mothers, who are pregnant for the first time mightn’t feel the movement of their babies till the 25th week of their pregnancy. By the second pregnancy, some mothers start to feel the movements as early as 16 weeks. In the beginning, the movements might feel like nervous twitches, hunger pangs, or simply butterflies in your tummy. That is one of the reasons why this movement is also called quickening. </p>
                        
                        <h5>Feeling the Kicks</h5>
                        <p>Babies often move to respond to sound, light, or in some cases, strong food. They can also move to stretch and relax. Moving can be quite relaxing for babies. The moments of the babies are different for everyone. While some babies are naturally active, others are quieter. That’s why the doctors recommend observing the patterns of movements of the baby rather than counting the movements. This will help you to recognize if the changes are taking place naturally or if there is something to be worried about. </p>
                        
                        
                        <p>The movement patterns can change at the end of the pregnancy. During this time, the movements might seem more like pokes, wriggles, or prods. However, note that the babies do not stop moving before labor. So, if you have any concerns about the movement of your baby, don’t hesitate to get in touch with your doctor right away. </p>
