                        <p>Oral care is as important as taking care of any other body part and should be an important part of our daily routine. But it is majorly neglected by most of the people on daily basis. Oral care refers to taking care of your mouth, tongue, and teeth. It does not just end with brushing your teeth as a morning ritual, there’s more to it. People don’t take dental health care seriously which later results in severe problems. Oral cancer also results from non-maintenance of dental hygiene and is life-threatening, if not treated at the earliest.  </p>
                        <p>You will be surprised to know that India has the highest number of oral cancers and other dental problems. The majority of people do not know about basic dental hygiene. They are unaware of the problems caused by poor oral health.  </p>

                        <p>People with improper diets who eat less are also at the receiving end of bad breath.
