                        <p>The most significant moment of a woman's life is when she gives birth. A woman's body changes a great deal as she goes through the multiple stages of pregnancy. We experience hormonal changes that lead to more changes in the body, mood swings, and weight gain. Women are naturally strong and capable of bringing life into the planet, but pregnancy takes a toll on them. While a magical time, it is also physically and emotionally draining for the woman experiencing it. Thus, women must opt for <b>pregnancy exercises</b> regularly to keep up with hormonal changes, gain weight, and maintain their health for a smooth experience. </p>
                        
                        
                        <h2>The Significance of Pregnancy Exercises </h2>
                        <p>The following reasons make it important for pregnant women to exercise: </p>
                        
                        <h3>Endorphins</h3>
                        <p>Physical activities like exercise release endorphins made and stored in the brain's pituitary gland. Endorphins are hormones that promote the feeling of wellness in one's body. Often referred to as the happy hormones, endorphins make people feel good and are thus great for pregnant women and their mood swings caused by hormonal changes. </p>
                         
                        <h3>Avoid Diabetes </h3>
                        <p>Most women are at risk of developing type 2 diabetes during pregnancy. An active lifestyle coupled with regular exercise can help would-be mothers to avoid catching the disease.  </p>
                        
                        <h3>Avoid Backache </h3>
                        <p>The weight gain and constant load of carrying the baby's weight cause frequent backaches in pregnant women. Regular exercise helps keep the body active and avoid backache.  </p>
                        
                        <h3>  Experience Better Sleep</h3>
                        <p>Pregnancy workouts can be tiring despite their low intensity. Regular exercise helps pregnant women sleep better and wake up fresh and well-rested in the morning. </p>
                        
                        <h3>Fast Recovery </h3>
                        <p>Frequent exercise keeps the body fit and makes it easier for women to recover after childbirth. They can also return to working out sooner than the women who did not exercise much and lose the extra weight they put on during pregnancy. </p>
                        
                        <h2>Safe Pregnancy Workout Exercises </h2>
                        <p>Many doctors suggest that exercising for 150 minutes per week is healthy for pregnant women. They can maintain this by exercising 3-5 times and taking two rest days weekly. A few of the safe pregnancy exercises are as follows:</p>
                        
                        <h3>Brisk Walking </h3>
                        <img src="{{asset('public_gurgaon/assets/images/blog/Brisk-Walking.png')}}" alt="" class="img-fluid mb-3" />
                        <p>Walking is one of the easiest pregnancy workouts. It balances the body weight, raises the heart rate, and overall affects the body. It keeps you active and away from the body ache that comes with pregnancy. Brisk walking is considered the most effective workout as it helps the entire body. </p>
                        
                       
                        <h3>Beginner Friendly Zumba/Aerobics</h3>
                        <img src="{{asset('public_gurgaon/assets/images/blog/Zumba in pregancy.png')}}" alt="" class="img-fluid mb-3" />
                        <p>Low-intensity Zumba and Aerobics are great cardio exercises. A healthy heart efficiently supplies oxygen to the body and keeps the mom and the baby inside her healthy. </p>
                        
                        <h3>Swimming </h3>
                        <img src="{{asset('public_gurgaon/assets/images/blog/Swimming-sci hospital.png')}}" alt="" class="img-fluid mb-3" />
                        <p>Swimming is a fun way of exercising and staying fit. Like brisk walking, swimming affects the overall body. Also, being in the water helps pregnant women feel light and relieve back aches. </p>
                        
                        <h3>Prenatal Pregnancy Yoga </h3>
                        <img src="{{asset('public_gurgaon/assets/images/blog/pregnant-woman-exercising-SCI Hospital.png')}}" alt="" class="img-fluid mb-3" />
                        <p>Certain yoga poses help the would-be mommies to stretch safely and maintain the flexibility of their bodies. They thus get their name prenatal/pregnancy yoga. However, it would help if you were careful and only did the prenatal poses to avoid putting pressure on your abdomen.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Jogging </h3>
                        <img src="{{asset('public_gurgaon/assets/images/blog/woman-jogging-during-pregnancy.png')}}" alt="" class="img-fluid mb-3" />
                        <p>Pregnant women who have excellent heart health. Jogging is another great exercise for cardio and does not put the body under pressure as much as running does. </p>
                        
                        <h3>Points to Remember </h3>
                        <p>Now that we know how beneficial pregnancy exercises are, these are the few things we should remember before setting an exercise schedule: </p>
                        
                        <h3>Do Not Overdo It </h3>
                        <p>Over-exercising can adversely affect you and your unborn child. You might end up causing significant damage to either if you aren't careful while exercising. </p>
                        
                        <h3>Keep Your Doctor in the Loop </h3>
                        <p>Always talk to your doctor about your pregnancy workouts during regular check-ups. This would keep the doctor in the loop, and they would be in a position to help stop you from doing something that is not good for you. </p>
                        
                        <h3>Avoid Any Exercise That Puts Pressure on the Abdomen </h3>
                        <p>Practising exercises that pressure the abdomen must be avoided at all costs. The child's weight exerts pressure on the uterus and the pelvic floor. Exercises that put pressure on the abdomen put more pressure on these organs and are capable of causing significant damage to the body. </p>
                        
                        <h3>Do Not Lift Weights </h3>
                        <p>Lifting weights might not be problematic for pregnant women per se. Still, any injury caused while lifting weights can be devastating for a pregnant woman. It is thus best if they stay away from the weights. </p>
                        
                        <h3>Wear Loose Clothes </h3>
                        <p>Wearing tight clothes during exercise is a norm now. However, pregnant women should stay away from them and wear loose clothes that help them breathe better and stay comfortable during their workout sessions. </p>
                        <p>Workout during pregnancy is beneficial to a woman's body. It is also necessary unless a doctor advises you not to, in special circumstances. It keeps the mind and body healthy and makes way for your speedy recovery. Practice caution and get on with the pregnancy workouts today. </p>
