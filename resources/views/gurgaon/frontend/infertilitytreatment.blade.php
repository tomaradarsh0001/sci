						<p>Male infertility occurs due to problems affecting either sperm transport or sperm production in men. Around two-thirds of men with infertility have a problem making sperms in testes. It usually affects around 7% of males due to certain deficiency in their semen quality – either lower sperm count or sperms don’t work properly.</p>
						<p>Reproduction is a natural process in most couples. However, some couples find it difficult to conceive. The fertility of a man typically depends on his sperm quality and quantity. If the sperm count is poor quality or low in number, it’s difficult or impossible to cause pregnancy.</p>
						<p>Reportedly, approximately 12–18 million couples in India face the issue of infertility every year. Some reports also suggest that the sperm count of an average Indian male used to be around 60 million/ml 30 years ago. However, it’s around 20 million/ml now.</p>
						<div class="mt-3 mt-lg-6"></div>
						<h2 class="theme-color">What is Low Sperm Count?</h2>
						<p>Low sperm count means when semen or fluid ejaculated by a man during an orgasm includes fewer sperms than average sperm count.</p>
						<p><strong>The condition of low sperm count is also known as oligospermia.</strong></p>
						<ul class="services_list">
							<li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> The sperm count is considered to be less than normal when the sperm count is less than 15 million sperm per millilitre of semen.</li>
							<li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> With a low sperm count, there are fewer chances of causing pregnancy in a fertile female.</li>
							<li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> However, some males with low sperm count can still become a father, depending on different circumstances.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>The condition of no sperm at all is called azoospermia.</p>
						
						<div class="mt-3 mt-lg-6"></div>
						<h3 class="theme-color">Causes of Male Infertility</h3>
						<p>Male infertility is diagnosed through a medical test that proves that the problem is found in the male. In most cases, you cannot find any obvious signs of infertility. Intercourse, ejaculations and erections usually occur without difficulty. Only a medical test can diagnose male infertility and its exact cause in the male.</p>
					    <ul class="services_list">
							<li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> Abnormal sperm production due to genetic defects, undescended testicles, health problems like diabetes or infections, such as gonorrhoea, Chlamydia, HIV or mumps. Enlarged veins within the testes can also affect sperm quality.</li>
							<li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> Issues with sperm delivery because of sexual problems like genetic conditions, such as cystic fibrosis, premature ejaculation, injury or damage to reproductive organs, and structural problems like a blockage in one or both testicles.</li>
							<li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> Overexposure to specific environmental factors like chemicals, pesticides and radiation. Alcohol, cigarette smoking, anabolic steroids, marijuana and taking medications for treating high blood pressure, depression and bacterial infections may also affect fertility in men. Frequent heat exposure during hot tub baths or saunas can also affect sperm production.</li>
						    <li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> Damage caused by cancer and its treatment, such as chemotherapy and exposure to radiation, can also impair sperm production.</li>
						</ul>
						
						<div class="mt-3 mt-lg-6"></div>
						<h3 class="theme-color">When and why men should contact male infertility doctor</h3>
						<p>The main sign of infertility is when you’re not able to get pregnant. There can be some other obvious signs and symptoms as well. In some cases, an infertile man may have certain signs of sexual problems or hormonal issues like erectile dysfunction or reduced body hair growth.</p>
						<p>When to see a doctor:</p>
						<p>You don’t need to see a male infertility specialist unless you are trying to get pregnant but failing constantly. Men must talk to a doctor when they:</p>
						<ul class="services_list">
							<li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> Have a low sperm count or problem in sperm production or function</li>
							<li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> Have a history of prostate, testicular or any sexual problem</li>
							<li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> Undergone cancer treatment</li>
							<li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> Have swelling in the scrotum or small testicles</li>
							<li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> Someone in their family had infertility issues</li>
						</ul>

						<h3 class="theme-color">Hospital for Male Infertility Treatment in Delhi</h3>
						<p>SCI is one of the leading male infertility treatment hospitals in Delhi. We have a team of specialists who deal with this widespread problem in males when they are not able to make their partner pregnant.</p>
						<p>In most cases, we can treat the problems associated with male infertility using medications or surgery. But in some rare cases, the medical treatment doesn’t work and the couples may decide to adopt a child or use a sperm donor.</p>
						<p>However, for the cases that can be treated, we follow different male infertility treatments like:</p>
						<p>IVF is a useful treatment method to cure unexplained infertility, failed IUI, endometriosis, etc.</p>
						<p>Besides IVF, we also follow other treatment procedures, such as Hormone Replacement Therapy, Varicococele Surgery and microTESE Surgery to treat male infertility.</p>
