                                <p>Endometriosis is usually a painful condition that develops through the growth of tissue resembling the inner and outside lining of the uterus, commonly impacting the ovaries, fallopian tubes, and pelvic tissue lining. In rare instances, endometriosis growths may extend beyond the usual confines of pelvic organ locations.</p>
                                <p>Endometriosis tissue works the same as uterus lining, thickening, breaking down, and bleeding during each menstrual cycle. But, it grows outside its normal place, leading to the formation of endometriomas on the ovaries, irritation in surrounding tissues, and the development of adhesions, causing pelvic organs to stick together.</p>

                                            <p><b>Retrograde Menstruation: </b>Menstrual blood flowing backward through fallopian tubes into the pelvic cavity carries endometrial cells, adhering to pelvic walls and surfaces, leading to growth and cyclic bleeding.</p>
                                            <p><b>Transformed Peritoneal Cells:</b> Experts think hormones or immune factors may turn abdominal cells into uterine-like cells.</p>
                                            <p><b>Embryonic Cell Changes:</b> It is possible for endometriosis to start when fetal cells change because of estrogen during puberty. This can lead to the growth of endometrial-like cells.</p>
                                            <p><b>Surgical Scar Complication:</b> Endometrial cells could attach to scar tissue, particularly resulting from abdominal surgeries such as C-sections, potentially initiating the development and endurance of endometriotic lesions.</p>
                                            <p><b>Endometrial Cell Transport:</b> Endometrial cells may be transported to various body parts via blood vessels or tissue fluid systems, establishing lesions outside the uterus and contributing to endometriosis.</p>
                                            <p><b>Immune System Condition:</b> The compromised immune system's failure to identify and remove endometriotic tissue may enable the uncontrolled growth and lasting presence of endometriosis lesions in the body.</p>
