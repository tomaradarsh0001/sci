          "text": "Passing a 13 mm kidney stone naturally is less likely compared to smaller stones. The ability to pass a stone depends on various factors, including its location, shape, and the individual's anatomy. In general, stones larger than 5-6 mm have a lower chance of passing independently and may require medical intervention."

          "@type": "Answer",

          "text": "A 17 mm kidney stone is considered quite large, and its management typically involves medical intervention. Common approaches to treat such large stones include:

    a. Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy (PCNL): This surgical procedure involves making a small incision in the back and using specialized instruments to remove or break up the stone.

    b. Laser Lithotripsy: For stones that cannot be removed directly, laser lithotripsy can be used to fragment the stone into smaller pieces that are easier to manage.

    c. Ureteroscopy: If the stone is located in the ureter or closer to the bladder, ureteroscopy with laser lithotripsy may be an option to remove or break up the stone."

In many cases, stones of this size may require surgical intervention, such as Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy (PCNL) or ureteroscopy with laser lithotripsy, to remove or break up the stone."

    a. Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy (PCNL): Surgical removal through a small back incision.

                                <p>
                                    Kidney stones are hard collections of minerals and salts that form in the kidneys. Kidney stones can be caused by many things, like the food you eat, being overweight, some medical conditions, and some
                                    vitamins and medicines. Your kidneys, bladder, or any other part of your urine system can be hurt by kidney stones. Stones generally form when urine gets too concentrated and lets minerals crystallize and
                                    stick together.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Kidney stones can be very painful to pass, but if they are caught early, they usually don't cause any big trouble. Taking the right medicine and drinking a lot of water may be all you need to do to get
                                    rid of a kidney stone. Surgery may be required if your situation is critical and SCI is a perfect choice for kidney stone treatment in Gurgaon.
