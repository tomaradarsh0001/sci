                                <p>The meaning of andrology comes from the Greek word 'Andros', which means male. It is a medical specialty that cures diseases related to men's reproductive systems. The male reproductive system is not just used for sexual activity rather it is used as a source of releasing urinary flow. Andrology is the study of problems with the connective tissues of the genitalia and changes in the size of the cells, like in genital enlargement or macrogenitosomia. In simple terms, we can understand andrology as male gynaecology. However, in recent years, it has gotten too much popularity because of men's fertility and prostate problems. Also, male hormones secreted by the testis affect the entire health of a man. </p>

                                 A. Andrology is a medical specialty that focuses on the study of male reproductive health and disorders. It encompasses the evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of various conditions related to the male reproductive system, including issues related to fertility, sexual function, and hormonal imbalances. Infertility, in the context of andrology, refers to the inability of a man to father a child due to factors such as low sperm count, poor sperm motility, or other male-related reproductive problems.

                                  A. Urology and andrology are related medical specialties, but they focus on different aspects of the male reproductive and urinary systems: 
                                  
                                  <p><b>Urology:</b> Urology is a broader medical specialty that deals with the diagnosis and treatment of both male and female urinary tract conditions and the male reproductive system. Urologists are trained to address a wide range of issues, including kidney stones, urinary incontinence, bladder problems, and urological cancers in both men and women. While urologists do have expertise in male reproductive health, they cover a broader spectrum of urological issues. </p>
                                  <p><b>Andrology: </b>Andrology, on the other hand, is a subspecialty of urology that specifically focuses on male reproductive health. Andrologists specialize in the assessment and treatment of male-specific conditions such as infertility, erectile dysfunction, hormonal imbalances, and disorders of the male reproductive organs. They have a more concentrated expertise in male reproductive medicine and may work closely with urologists when necessary. </p>
                                  <p>In summary, while urology encompasses a wide range of urinary and reproductive issues in both genders, andrology is a specialized field within urology that is exclusively dedicated to the study and treatment of male reproductive health and infertility. </p>
