The hymen is associated with purity in some cultures and vice versa due to its symbolic significance. By surgically sewing together the remaining pieces of the original hymen or utilizing tissue from the vaginal lining, hymenoplasty creates the illusion of an entire hymen. This treatment is done for religious, cultural, or personal reasons to make it look like the hymen is still there.  </p>

                                            <p><b>Hymen Stitching:</b> This is a common type of surgery for hymenoplasty; in this process, the surgeon will sew all broken or remaining hymens. Which caused you trouble in the past; these stitches often dissolve after a few days. And when the surgery is done, you can easily go home. </p>
                                            <p><b>Hymen Reconstruction:</b> This surgery is done by surgeons if there is enough tissue to stitch the hymen together. The hymen would be reconstructed from living tissue collected from your body. You can live your life aesthetically without any worry after completing this surgery, but you should avoid sexual relations for 3–4 months. </p>
                                            <p><b>Alloplant technique:</b> This process is performed if the above surgeries fail, then the alloplant technique can be used to reconstruct the hymen. The alloplant technique is an artificial method of building hymen tissues.  The alloplant is made of plastics that have been changed chemically, it is often used for transplants.  </p>
