                        <p>The male reproductive system has a small, muscular gland called the prostate. The muscular action of the prostate helps propel the semen and fluid from the penis during the sexual climax. However, many men (especially those above 50 years of age) experience prostate enlargement that leads to various complications over time. One can opt for enlarged prostate treatment after diagnosis to deal with enlarged prostate problems. </p>

                        <h2 class="theme-color">What is BPH (benign prostatic hyperplasia)? </h2>

                        <p>The enlargement of the prostate gland is known as benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). This happens when the cells of the prostate gland start multiplying. The additional cells further lead to swelling in the prostate gland and squeezing the urethra, restricting the urine flow. This condition is not the same as <a href="https://scihospital.com/blog/prostate-cancer-know-the-symptoms-and-treatment" style="color:#000"><b><u>prostate cancer</u></b></a> and does not even increase the risk of cancer. However, it may affect an individual’s quality of life. Thus, one should opt for enlarged prostate treatment after proper consultation regarding their enlarged prostate problems. </p>
                        
                        <div class="mt-3 mt-lg-6"></div>
                        <h2 class="theme-color">Causes of BPH  </h2>

                        <p>The prostate gland is underneath the bladder. The tube that passes urine from the urinary bladder out of the penis (urethra) goes through the middle of the prostate gland. When the prostate enlarges, it narrows down the passage of the urinary tube. Hence, it blocks the urine flow and requires enlarged prostate treatment.</p>
                        <p>Many men experienced continued growth of the prostate throughout their life. On the other hand, some men experience this continued growth that enlarges the prostate and causes certain urinary symptoms or blocks urine flow.</p>
                        <p>It is not clear what leads to prostate enlargement or enlarged prostate problems. However, it may occur due to the changes caused by an imbalance of sex hormones as men age. The changes in male sex hormones also come with many aging factors, such as abnormalities in testicles or a family history of prostate issues may increase the risk of BPH. One can still go for enlarged prostate treatment. However, men who have got their testicles removed at a young age won’t experience BPH.</p>

                        <h2 class="theme-color">Symptoms of Enlarged Prostate (BPH)</h2>
                        <p>The symptoms of BPH are mild in the beginning but increase if it’s not treated. Therefore, enlarged prostate treatment is necessary.</p>
                        <p>Some common symptoms are:</p>
                        <ul class="services_list">
                            <li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> Nocturia – increased urination frequency at night</li>
                            <li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> Urgent or frequent need to urinate</li>
                            <li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> Problem to start urination</li>
                            <li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> Dribbling at the end of urination</li>
                            <li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> Not being able to empty the bladder completely</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <div class="mt-3 mt-lg-6"></div>
                        <h2 class="theme-color">Less Common Symptoms of BPH</h2>
                        <ul class="services_list">
                            <li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> Inability to urinate</li>
                            <li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> Urinary tract infection</li>

                        </ul>
                        <p>The size of the prostate gland does not determine how severe the symptoms are. Some men with a slightly enlarged prostate can also experience significant symptoms, whereas sometimes men with extremely large prostates may only experience minor urinary symptoms. Either way, it is better to get checked and go ahead with the enlarged prostate treatment.</p>
                        <p>Other conditions that may lead to signs and symptoms caused by the enlarged prostate are as follows:</p>
                       <ul class="services_list">
                           <li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> Inflammation of prostatitis</li>

                       </ul>
                       
                       <p>Consult the doctor if any of these symptoms persist so that you can get the enlarged prostate treatment.</p>
                       <div class="mt-3 mt-lg-6"></div>
                       <h2 class="theme-color">Risk Factors Of BPH</h2>
                       <p><strong>Ageing:</strong> Prostate gland enlargement rarely presents with specific signs and symptoms in men under the age of 40.  Around one-third of men notice moderate to severe symptoms around the age of 50 and some do so around the age of 80 when it comes to enlarged prostate problems. </p>
                        <p><strong>Family history:</strong> If any blood relative, such as a brother or father, has enlarged prostate problems, you’re also likely to have them.</p>
                        <p><strong>Heart disease and diabetes:</strong> According to the studies, heart disease and diabetes can also enhance the risk of BPH.</p>
                        <p><strong>Obesity: </strong>Being overweight can also increase the risk of prostate enlargement and problems associated with an enlarged prostate, for which one may require treatment. Regular exercise, on the other hand, can help lower this risk.</p>

                            <li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> BPH Natural Treatment: Some natural enlarged prostate treatment methods for treating BPH are:</li>
                            <li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> Urinating whenever you feel the urgency.</li>
                            <li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> Avoiding over-the-counter antihistamine or decongestant medications that may make the bladder hard to empty.</li>
                            <li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> Avoiding caffeine and alcohol, especially after dinner.</li>
                            <li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> Exercise regularly to lower the symptoms.</li>
                            <li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> Staying warm is important, as cold temperatures could potentially worsen the symptoms.</li>
                            <li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> BPH Drugs: When lifestyle changes don’t relieve the symptoms, the doctor would prescribe certain medications for enlarged prostate treatment.</li>
                            <li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> Hormone reduction medications: These medications are used for reducing the hormonal levels released by the prostate gland. Finasteride and dutasteride are usually prescribed to decrease the levels of testosterone. This is done because sometimes lowering hormone levels can also make the prostate smaller, enabling convenient urine flow to facilitate enlarged prostate treatment.</li>
                            <li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> Antibiotics: Even antibiotics can be used for the treatment of the prostate that has become severely inflamed due to bacterial prostatitis. Taking antibiotics for treating bacterial prostatitis can improve BPH symptoms by reducing inflammation. However, antibiotics cannot relieve the inflammation or prostatitis caused due to bacterial infection.</li>
                            <li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> Alpha-1 blockers: These medications are used to relax prostate and bladder muscles. These medications relax the neck of the bladder for convenient urine flow. Some examples of alpha-1 blockers prescribed for enlarged prostate treatment are:</li>
                            <li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> Prazosin</li>
                            <li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> Doxazosin</li>
                            <li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> Alfuzosin</li>

                        <p>There are many surgical procedures for treating BPH when drugs are not effective. These procedures require hospitalization for up to 10 days or more, depending on the procedure and recovery process.</p>
                        
                            <p> <strong>Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP):</strong> The doctor inserts a small instrument through the urethra into the prostate to remove tissues piece by piece.</p>
                            <p> <strong>Simple Prostatectomy:</strong> The abdomen is cut just behind the scrotum to remove the inner part of the prostate.</p>
                            <p> <strong>Transurethral Incision of the Prostate (TUIP):</strong> Similar to transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), a small incision is made in the prostate to widen the urethra and improve urine flow from the bladder outlet through the urethra.</p>
                       
                        
                        
                        <div class="mt-3 mt-lg-6"></div>
                        <h3 class="theme-color"><b>Types of Enlarged Prostate Surgery</b></h3>
                        <p><h3>Laser Surgery: </h3>For enlarged prostate, laser surgery is done by inserting a scope from the urethra into the prostate. Then, the laser beam is passed from the scope to remove prostate tissues by ablation (melting) or cutting. Holmium laser ablation of the prostate (HoLAP) is quite similar; however, a different laser type is used in this procedure.</p>
                        <p><h3>Open Simple Prostatectomy: </h3>This type of enlarged prostate treatment involves an open surgery that is done in complicated cases of the highly enlarged prostate. In Open Simple Prostatectomy, the doctor makes an incision under the navel via laparoscopy to remove a small part of the prostate that’s blocking the urine flow.</p>
                        
                        <div class="mt-3 mt-lg-6"></div>
                        <h3 class="theme-color"><b>Advantages of Laser Surgery for Prostate</b></h3>
                        
                            <p><b>Lower Risk of Blood Loss:</b> Since there is a lower risk of blood loss with laser surgery, it is a good option for men who have a bleeding disorder that won’t allow blood to clot or men who take medicine for thinning the blood.</p>
                            <p> <b>No or Shorter Hospital Stay:</b> All thanks to laser surgery for enlarged prostate treatment, patients no longer have to stay in the hospital for days. Laser surgery is done on an outpatient basis or needs only an overnight stay for just one day.</p>
                            <p><b>Quicker Recovery Time:</b> It takes very little time to recover from laser surgery compared to TURP or open surgery.</p>
                            <p> <b>Quicker Results:</b> After laser surgery, you can notice improvements in urinary symptoms right away. One can observe instant improvement after the enlarged prostate treatment.</p>

                                BPH has long been treated with medications and procedures including lasers or an electric loop that burns the prostate from the inside out. However, a comparatively new convective water therapy treatment uses steam to shrink the prostate. This treatment is also known as benign prostatic hyperplasia.

                               The underlying reason for prostate enlargement is unknown, but it is thought to be related to hormonal changes that occur as men age. As you age, the balance of hormones in your body changes, which may cause your prostate gland to grow.
