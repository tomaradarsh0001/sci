                        <p>The Allurion Balloon, originally the Elipse Balloon, is a novel weight loss strategy created to help you cut back on your calorie intake. The first gastric balloon that may be placed or removed without obesity surgery, endoscopy, or anesthesia is this soft balloon.  </p>
                        <p>The weight loss balloon helps you cut on your food intake by taking up space in your stomach; on average, patients lose 10 to 15 kg of weight in just 16 weeks. Start living a healthy lifestyle right away! The Balloon is not just a band-aid, but a fully supported weight loss journey.  </p>
                        <p>A soft balloon is inserted into your stomach. During a quick appointment visit, the balloon is inflated in under 15 minutes and after 16 weeks, it spontaneously deflates and passes. By expanding the impression of constant fullness, the balloon takes up space in your stomach and encourages weight reduction.  </p>
                        <p>It implies that you are more inclined to reduce your daily calorie intake. Results may vary since the elipse Balloon is a 6-month lifestyle complete program created specifically for you. But after 16 weeks of the balloon Program, patients lose 10 to 15% of their body weight on average and keep off up to 95% of that weight reduction.  </p>

                        <p>A release valve will open after 16 weeks of therapy, allowing the balloon to deflate and travel naturally through your digestive system without the need for obesity surgery to remove it. The empty balloon may, on extremely rare occasions, be vomited, although this is not dangerous. The Allurion Balloon is the first gastric balloon that may be ingested and naturally eliminated months later.  </p>
                        <p>The past generations required endoscopic surgery and required anesthesia to insert and remove. Your convenience, comfort, and safety come first, and no surgery, endoscopy, or anesthesia is required. Typically, the Balloon is positioned throughout a brief outpatient appointment, allowing you to return home. All the assistance you require to succeed will be provided to you as a participant in the complete Allurion Program along with affordable Allurion balloon cost in India.  </p>
                        <p>A group of caring healthcare experts, including a consultant and a nutritionist, will lead you. Your care team will be provided a wireless digital scale that communicates regular updates on your development, and multiple meetings with your team will help you benefit fully from your Balloon.</p>

                        <p>About one-third of patients experience pain and nausea right away after having an balloon inserted. However, following balloon installation, these symptoms often only persist for a few days. The majority of the time, oral drugs used at home can control these symptoms. Although extremely unlikely, placing a weight loss balloon may have negative side effects. If you experience nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain following surgery, call your doctor right once.  </p>
                        <p>Balloon deflation is a potential concern. There is also a chance that the balloon could pass through your digestive tract if it deflates. This may result in a blockage, which may necessitate further treatment or surgery to remove the device. Overinflation, severe pancreatitis, ulcers, or a hole (perforation) in the stomach wall are other potential dangers that might necessitate surgery.  </p>
